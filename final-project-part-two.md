# User Research 

#### User Research Protocol

In the course of these interviews, I hope to find out how effective my communication about the problem is. I hope that upon reviewing my data visualizations, the arc of the story is clear: 

Setup: Trend towards decline in smoking from the 1900’s to the modern day
Conflict: Post 2015, steep rise in e-cigarette usage, particularly among teens
Resolution: The city of SF banned it, followed by the entire state of CA. Our call to action is to ban it across the nation. 

The target audience for my final project has changed from my initial idea – of targeting this story towards policy makers and impacted individuals. As I developed this story further, I decided that my message was best heard by a wider group of people – all constituents in the United States who have a direct or indirect interest in curbing community harm through legislation banning the use of flavored e-cigarette products. As such, my story will now aim to draw a direct line between how banning flavored e-cigarettes leads to an increase in youth wellness and community health, and a decrease in youth addiction rates. This emphasis will be used to advocate for the passage of federal legislation banning the sale of flavored e-cigarette products. 

To conduct this user research, I recruited peers and individuals who have varied histories with smoking and vaping. They also have different first moments when they experimented with these devices, whether they never picked up the habit, or began as teenagers or young adults. By selecting individuals with different histories with nicotine usage, I hoped to clarify my messaging to be the most understandable and actionable to a diverse group of people. I also sought to engage users who would both be typical users and atypical users. 

In the case of teenage nicotine usage through flavored e-cigarettes, it was not possible for me to recruit young adults directly. Instead, I spoke to my peers who had been young adults at one point. I selected individuals who do use e-cigarettes, or who have tried it as the typical user for this story and call to action. I selected individuals who have never tried e-cigarettes or nicotine at large as my atypical users – they are not directly impacted, but may still have a vested interest in this story and call to action. 

To these ends, I selected the following individuals for my second round of user research:
Person 1: Graduate Student who vapes occasionally recreationally, when drinking only. 
Person 2: Graduate Student who does vape and smoke.
Person 3: Graduate Student who is and has always been nicotine free.

#### FORMAT: 

The format for user interviews was as follows: 
- 45 minute interview slots, typically interviews were under 30 minutes. 
- 2-3 minute demonstration of wireframe/shorthand
- 20 minute User Research Questions
  - What do you think the call to action is? 
  - Who do you think the target audience is? 
  - Which of these data visualizations was the most impactful? Why? 
  - Which one of these was the least impactful? Why? 
  - What was confusing about this? 
  - What would you change? 
  - Do you have any concluding thoughts that I might not have asked a direct question about? 

#### FINDINGS: 
The findings from this user research were as follows: 

###### User 1
Non-peronally identifiable information: Graduate student, Male, 26-34, began smoking as a teenager (17 years of age), smokes both cigarettes and vapes. 

What do you think the call to action is? 
- Stop e-cig smoking among teens
Who do you think the target audience is? 
- State lawmakers and concerned citizens 
Which of these data visualizations was the most impactful? Why? 
Which one of these was the least impactful? Why? 
- Visualizations are severely lacking. 
What was confusing about this? 
- The framing of the risks and the health effects could be more explicitly outlined. They were painted in broad strokes instead of precisely articulated. 
What would you change? 
- The call to action’s narrative could be more integrated with the rest of it. With the list of risks punctuating the urgency for change. 
Do you have any concluding thoughts that I might not have asked a direct question about? 
- The original comparison idea was nice. I think that the impact could be better understood if you compared two cities or states. 

###### User 2
Non-peronally identifiable information: Graduate Student, male, 26-34 never smoked

What do you think the call to action is? 
- Ban the sale of flavored vapes 
Who do you think the target audience is? 
- Policy makers and individuals 
Which of these data visualizations was the most impactful? Why? 
Which one of these was the least impactful? Why? 
- No visualizations!! 
What was confusing about this? 
- The connection between e-cigarettes and flavor is not fully fleshed out. It would be better to add some information about that. 
What would you change? 
- I would include more visuals and graphics than are currently included. 
Do you have any concluding thoughts that I might not have asked a direct question about? 
- I was confused about the state of ca information, it doesnt really tie into anything else. I would de-emphasize it a bit. 

###### User 3
Non-peronally identifiable information: Graduate student, female, 18-24, occasional social smoker since teens 
What do you think the call to action is? 
- Signing up to support the end of e-cigarettes 
Who do you think the target audience is? 
- The target audience is average people who will sign a survey
Which of these data visualizations was the most impactful? Why? 
Which one of these was the least impactful? Why? 
- There were no visualizations I saw. 
What was confusing about this? 
- I didn't like how the color scheme was all dark in the back. I think a white space in the background would be better. The part where you talk about the harms of tobacco could be more in depth to incentivize people better. 
What would you change? 
- I am not sure. I think you need more data and information in general. Right now it all seems really high level without any key insights.  
Do you have any concluding thoughts that I might not have asked a direct question about? 
No.  

#### Conclusion
This week I had a lot of trouble with finding the right data in order to make my point. As I came up with this project, I thought of the story I wanted to tell, in terms of what felt important to me. As someone who lived in San Francisco for many years, I thought that a story about a reduction in smoking would be a useful tool moving forward. However, I am finding that there is much debate around the efficacy of San Francisco's ban on e-cigarettes. In addition, there seem to be some years 2013-2014 specifically, where information is missing in some of the data sets I planned to use. 

Given the feedback I got in my user interviews, I think I will move forward by more explicitly laying out the impacts of tobacco usage, espcially on young people. Additionally, I will make sure that I am defining what e-cigarettes are and the increased risks of flavored tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. Finally, if a state comparison for California falls short, I may include some information on what the state of legislation is overall.
