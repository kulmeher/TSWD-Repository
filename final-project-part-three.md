# Banning Flavored E-Cigarettes
## The Impact on Our Youth

As week seven ends, my final project came to fruition. I wanted to provide a glimpse of my process through the last few weeks. 

### The Idea
I began with a simple idea: I wanted to explore the link between the rise of e-cigarettes, and youth smoking habits. The e-cigarette industry has clearly targeted young people with flavored e-cigarettes. The best way for someone to never become addicted to smoking or nicotine, it to never begin. My hypothesis was that e-cigarettes were being used to increase youth dependence on nicotine, through the advent of new technology, to continue to capitalize on generations of addictive behavior because of nicotine.

With this premise, I began the 3 week iterative process. 

#### Part 1 
Originally, I hoped to illustrate the linkage between e-cigarettes and youth nicotine consumption habits, with a call to action focused on a clear policy outcome: The banning of e-cigarettes and flavored tobacco products. To emphasize the benefit of such a policy, I hoped to draw a comparison between two cities: Pittsburgh, PA and San Francisco, CA. In 2018, San Francisco became the first city in the United States to unilaterally ban all flavored tobacco products. [^1]

Following that ban on flavored tobacco products in San Francisco, Califoria followed by banning the sale of flavored tobacco products in 2022. [^2]

I wanted my narrative to follow a compelling structure, so I planned to use the following story arc: 

    - Setup: Nicotine Addiction has been dropping across the world
    - Conflict: Flavored tobacco products are increasing youth nicotine usage
    - Resolution: Where flavored tobacco products and e-cigarettes are banned, this worrying trend can be reversed. 

This story arc proved to be very useful for the rest of the project development. However, data challenges in Part 2 led to an update of the Resolution to reflect the statistical unreliability of the effectiveness of the San Francisco ban due to paucity of large sized data sets [^3], and studies which indicated that the ban increased tobacco usage in San Francisco[^4]. Though my information search led to an explanation ([Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0416.pdf)) for the contradicting nature of these results, I decided to stay away from the comparison entirely. 

#### Part 2
In the second week, I began work on the final form of my project on Shorthand for narrative, supplemented by data visualization. I had hoped to use the data that I had originally outlined for use. Here, I ran into the challenges described above. I found myself unable to tell the story I had hoped to tell about San Francisco. I looked with other stories that I could tell with my data, but found that the CDC datasets that I hoped to work with were yearly datasets, with information at state levels about nicotine usage. This data had already been used to create easily accessible visualizations

In week two, I dove deeper into my user research, recruiting folks who I knew to be active users of nicotine, occasional users of nicotine, and never users of nicotine.
