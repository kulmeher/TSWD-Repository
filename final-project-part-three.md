# Banning Flavored E-Cigarettes
## The Impact on Our Youth

As week seven ends, my final project came to fruition. I wanted to provide a glimpse of my process through the last few weeks. 

### The Idea
I began with a simple idea: I wanted to explore the link between the rise of e-cigarettes, and youth smoking habits. The e-cigarette industry has clearly targeted young people with flavored e-cigarettes. The best way for someone to never become addicted to smoking or nicotine, it to never begin. My hypothesis was that e-cigarettes were being used to increase youth dependence on nicotine, through the advent of new technology, to continue to capitalize on generations of addictive behavior because of nicotine.

With this premise, I began the 3 week iterative process. 

#### Part 1 
Originally, I hoped to illustrate the linkage between e-cigarettes and youth nicotine consumption habits, with a call to action focused on a clear policy outcome: The banning of e-cigarettes and flavored tobacco products. To emphasize the benefit of such a policy, I hoped to draw a comparison between two cities: Pittsburgh, PA and San Francisco, CA. In 2018, San Francisco became the first city in the United States to unilaterally ban all flavored tobacco products. [^1]

Following that ban on flavored tobacco products in San Francisco, Califoria followed by banning the sale of flavored tobacco products in 2022. [^2]

I wanted my narrative to follow a compelling structure, so I planned to use the following story arc: 

    - Setup: Nicotine Addiction has been dropping across the world
    - Conflict: Flavored tobacco products are increasing youth nicotine usage
    - Resolution: Where flavored tobacco products and e-cigarettes are banned, this worrying trend can be reversed. 

This story arc proved to be very useful for the rest of the project development. However, data challenges in Part 2 led to an update of the Resolution to reflect the statistical unreliability of the effectiveness of the San Francisco ban due to paucity of large sized data sets [^3], and studies which indicated that the ban increased tobacco usage in San Francisco[^4]. Though my information search led to an explanation ([Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0416.pdf)) for the contradicting nature of these results, I decided to stay away from the comparison entirely. 

#### Part 2
In the second week, I began work on the final form of my project on Shorthand for narrative, supplemented by data visualization. Creating a moodboard for the story was helpful in creating my project outline in Shorthand. 

I had hoped to use the data that I had originally outlined for use. Here, I ran into the challenges described above. I found myself unable to tell the story I had hoped to tell about San Francisco. I looked with other stories that I could tell with my data, but found that the CDC datasets that I hoped to work with were yearly datasets, with information at state levels about nicotine usage. This data had already been used to create easily accessible visualizations

In week two, I also dove deeper into my user research, recruiting folks who I knew to be active users of nicotine, occasional users of nicotine, and never users of nicotine. These users gave me valuable information about the way my narrative was shaping up, helping me to create a more impactful story. 

#### Part 3
In the final week of this project, I really started to see my project come together. The most beneficial step was finding data that existed in a way where I could use it. The data from my project primarily came from the [American Lung Association](https://www.lung.org/research/trends-in-lung-disease/tobacco-trends-brief/overall-tobacco-trends). 

I created visualizations that would follow along with my original story arc. 

    - Setup: To illustrate the dropping nicotine consumption rates, I created two graphs that showed how tobacco consumption had been dropping in the United States for adults and for teens and children. 
    - Conflict: To illustrate the impact of flavored e-cigarettes on youth nicotine usage, I created a graph that showed a increase in youth e-cigarettes usage, from 1.5 in 2011 to 27.5 in 2019. This increase was over 1,733%! To further demonstrate this point, I added in a counter, which increases from 0 to 1,733. 
    - Resolution: My original resolution: "Where flavored tobacco products and e-cigarettes are banned, this worrying trend can be reversed." had to be changed as I was no longer undertaking a comparison between San Francisco and another city. To this end, I added some text to incentivize users to care about the problem enough to take action. Finally, I ended with a specific call to action for a person looking to implement policy changes to limit the sale of e-cigarettes and flavored tobacco, as well as a call to action message to support current e-cigarette users. 
    
I followed up the creation of these data visualizations with another round of user research, with the same folks I ran my story by in Part 2. In Part 2, a lack of visualizations made it difficult for my user's to provide any feedback on the data visualization aspects of it. In this section of user research, I tried to simplify the questions asked to only 2: 
    1. Is the story here clear? 
    2. Do you think the visualizations are supporting the narrative? 

To both of these questions, I received generally positive feedback, except for one visualization, which all three users commented on. This visualization is represented below: 

![Tableau Visualization](Sheet 1 (4).png)

The critique I received about this visualization can be summarized into 2 points: 1. The story was about youth vaping, and a contrast with adults, while helpful, was not as useful as the counter % tracker. 2. The visualization was rendering in a difficult to read manner on my shorthand.

I removed the visualization and found that I agreed with the feedback, so kept it out of my final Shorthand. I have included it here as insight into my process. 

I identified as my audience two general personas: 1. A lay-person interested in public health and advocacy, who would be willing to undertake a short action, and 2. a current e-cigarette user, who may need support in quitting. The current e-cigarette youth user input came from one of my user interviews, where someone pointed out that I should not omit my target demographic from my call to action. 

Overall, my iterative process through these last 3 weeks has shown me how much a clear data visualization and narrative structure can highlight and enhance the core message of a project. This process will be helpful to me for the rest of my life, as I go forward and try to share my ideas to make a difference.
