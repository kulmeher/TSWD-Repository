# About me

I'm a first year student at Carnegie Mellon, pursuing a Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM for short). I am seeking to use data and visualizations to make complicated material readily digestible. I come to this work from a background in racial and economic justice. I chose to pursue a graduate degree in order to further equity in the United States, through a combination of data driven-policy, technology, and good old fashioned hard work. 

Currently, I'm hoping to push forward an explicitly equity oriented agenda in the tech space. As new technology continues to change our daily lives, I hope for a future where we are not reactively seeking to legislate or litigate preferential outcomes, but one where we bodly push forward equitable solutions to the issues of today. I see data visualization as an important part of this mission, to communicate succintly and effectively with my peers about important issues, that too often get lost within legalese and technical jargon. I hope to use the tools I learn here to communicate dense information in a palatable way. 

We live in a world of abundance, where we could all be guaranteed life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, AND housing, healthcare, and opportunities to prosper collectively. Through effective policy choices, we can assure this future for the next generation. To create an appetite for these policies, we need effective methods of communication. That's where learning how to tell stories with data comes in.  


# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more than my brain and my body have the time for! But, in these short few months, I would be happy to come away with a deeper understanding of: 

1. How to develop a public portfolio chronicling my attempts at useful and practical data visualizations
2. How to use new software, like Tableau
3. Color Theory -- and its applicability to the field of public policy


# Portfolio
Hi! This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! Over the course of this semester, this is where I will be uploading all of my cool work. I hope you will want to hire me after this! 

### Assignments

#### Week 1: 
In Week 1, we did not have any public assignments. 

#### Week 2: [Visualizing Government Debt](https://kulmeher.github.io/TSWD-Repository/visualizing-government-debt.html)

#### Week 3: [Critique By Design: Data Visualization is Hard!](https://kulmeher.github.io/TSWD-Repository/critique-by-design.html) 

### Final Project
[final project I](https://kulmeher.github.io/TSWD-Repository/final-project-part-one)
[final project II](https://kulmeher.github.io/TSWD-Repository/final-project-part-two)
[final project III](https://kulmeher.github.io/TSWD-Repository/final-project-part-three)
[Shorthand Final Project](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/banning-flavored-e-cigarettes/index.html)

In retrospect, I did learn all of my goals listed above. I feel extremely confident with my first two goals, and hope to delve deeper into color theory in the future.
