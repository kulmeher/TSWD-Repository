# Critique by Design: Data Visualization is Harder than it Seems! 

This week, we were tasked with searching for a data visualization we thought we could improve, to workshop it through an intensive process involving critiquing, prototyping, refining and recreating a final data visualization. 
To aid us in this process, we were provided with a framework through which to critique and recreate the data visualization of our choice. According to this framework from Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile] (http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf), we were to focus on the following: 
1. Informativeness
2. Emotiveness

Within these broad categories, we looked at the usefulness, completeness, perceptability, and truthfulness of the data from the point of informing audiences, and aesthetics and engagement from the point of view of creating an emotive reaction for the audience. 

### 1. Finding a Data Visualization

Initially, I had some trouble locating a data visualization. I perused news sources -- the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and the Economist -- to no avail. Their data visualization's seemed to meet the expectations set by the class, and I did not think that I could produce better content within a week long period. I turned instead to resources provided within the classroom. 

The data visualization I chose came from an example provided through the class, which spoke to me on a personal level: Internet Financial Crimes. Immediately upon perusing the data, I realized that I could think of several examples from my own experience, of people close to me falling victim to a financial crime -- online rental scams, business and personal email compromises, and personal data breaches were all events that I had supported friends and family through. I chose to hone in on California as my state of choice, for it's large data set and as the unlucky state to have the largest number of victims, and amount of money lost to these crimes. 

With my data visualization selected, ([2020 Internet Crime Report: FBI, subsetted for California])(https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020State/StateReport.aspx#?s=6) I was ready to move on with the assignment. 

### 2. Critiquing the Visualization
Having selected my data visualization, I moved on to critiquing it. I found that my main issues with the visualization could be broadly summarized into the following: 
- The use of color was not conducive to telling a story
- The data was not organized in a manner that pointed to a single story above another
- The data was segmented in such a way that important stories were being lost to the target population -- certain internet financial crimes impacted people disproportionately. 

### 3. Wireframing a Solution
After completing my critique, I was ready to begin with a new data visualization. At first, my attempt to consolidate data produced an output that was lacking in clarity -- an essential need for a useful data visualization. This was my hardest attempt -- try as I might, I could not figure out how to create a visualization that worked to show the same data I had imagined. 

My Tableau Visualization: 
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1675833178246' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='What Internet Crimes Cost the Most to Individuals? Surprisingly, not the ones with the largest victim counts ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Nu&#47;NumberofPeopleImpactedbyOnlineFinancialCrimes&#47;Sheet4&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='NumberofPeopleImpactedbyOnlineFinancialCrimes&#47;Sheet4' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Nu&#47;NumberofPeopleImpactedbyOnlineFinancialCrimes&#47;Sheet4&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1675833178246');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

### 4. Testing this Visualization
I conducted user research on two subjects in different fields. 

##### Subject Number 1
Subject Number 1 was a white male, between 25-35 years of age, who is currently a teacher. I asked him the following questions. His responses follow. 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
According to the title, this seems to be a chart about the different kinds of crimes that impact people, how much they lost, and how many people were impacted by the crimes. 

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Business Emails are the highest dollar cost, while non-payment or delivery impacts the most people. 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
The way its presented is a little confusing, I need to move back and forth across the graph to get what it is about. I wish that there were more numbers and a more cohesive method of showing your points. I understand because of the title and because I took the time to look at this information. 

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
I think the intended audience is policy folks, who need this information to legislate crimes. 

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Thevisualization looks clunky,  the subject line is too long, and  the lack of numbers at the end of the data sources makes it confusing to look at what the actual bar chart numbers mean. I might try to combine them both into a single chart. 

##### Testing a new visualization
At this point, I had some time before my next user interview. I used this time to quickly sketch out a new visualization. I used this new visualization and the prior visualization in order to solicit the second round of user feedback.

##### Subject Number 2
Subject Number 2 was an Asian male, between 25-35 years of age, who is currently a student. I asked him the following questions. His responses follows. 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
This is a sketch for an internet crimes

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
