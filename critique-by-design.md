# Critique by Design: Data Visualization is Harder than it Seems! 

This week, we were tasked with searching for a data visualization we thought we could improve, to workshop it through an intensive process involving critiquing, prototyping, refining and recreating a final data visualization. 
To aid us in this process, we were provided with a framework through which to critique and recreate the data visualization of our choice. According to this framework from Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile] (http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf), we were to focus on the following: 
1. Informativeness
2. Emotiveness

Within these broad categories, we looked at the usefulness, completeness, perceptability, and truthfulness of the data from the point of informing audiences, and aesthetics and engagement from the point of view of creating an emotive reaction for the audience. 

The data visualization I chose came from an example provided through the class, which spoke to me on a personal level: Internet Financial Crimes.
