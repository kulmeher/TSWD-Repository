# Critique by Design: Data Visualization is Harder than it Seems! 

This week, we were tasked with searching for a data visualization we thought we could improve, to workshop it through an intensive process involving critiquing, prototyping, refining and recreating a final data visualization. 
To aid us in this process, we were provided with a framework through which to critique and recreate the data visualization of our choice. According to this framework from Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile] (http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf), we were to focus on the following: 
1. Informativeness
2. Emotiveness

Within these broad categories, we looked at the usefulness, completeness, perceptability, and truthfulness of the data from the point of informing audiences, and aesthetics and engagement from the point of view of creating an emotive reaction for the audience. 

### 1. Finding a Data Visualization

Initially, I had some trouble locating a data visualization. I perused news sources -- the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and the Economist -- to no avail. Their data visualization's seemed to meet the expectations set by the class, and I did not think that I could produce better content within a week long period. I turned instead to resources provided within the classroom. 

The data visualization I chose came from an example provided through the class, which spoke to me on a personal level: Internet Financial Crimes. Immediately upon perusing the data, I realized that I could think of several examples from my own experience, of people close to me falling victim to a financial crime -- online rental scams, business and personal email compromises, and personal data breaches were all events that I had supported friends and family through. I chose to hone in on California as my state of choice, for it's large data set and as the unlucky state to have the largest number of victims, and amount of money lost to these crimes. 

With my data visualization selected, ([2020 Internet Crime Report: FBI, subsetted for California])(https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020State/StateReport.aspx#?s=6) I was ready to move on with the assignment. 

### 2. Critiquing the Visualization
Having selected my data visualization, I moved on to critiquing it. I found that my main issues with the visualization could be broadly summarized into the following: 
- The use of color was not conducive to telling a story
- The data was not organized in a manner that pointed to a single story above another
- The data was segmented in such a way that important stories were being lost to the target population -- certain internet financial crimes impacted people disproportionately. 

### 3. Wireframing a Solution
After completing my critique, I was ready to begin with a new data visualization. At first, my attempt to consolidate data produced an output that was lacking in clarity -- an essential need for a useful data visualization.
